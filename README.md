Web interface to Firefox Sync Bookmarks

I can see this being useful in at least two situations:
* You're not on your personal PC and want to access your bookmarks without sync'ing your entire collection to the machine
* You want to use this as a bookmark sharing "platform" like Delicious, Shaarli, etc. (this is what I use it for)

## Instructions

* Copy the files to your server and point your vhost's DocumentRoot to the public_html folder.
* Insert your configuration settings in /private/config.php.dist
* Rename /private/config.php.dist to /private/config.php
